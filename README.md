## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

The idea is exclusively from Venturus.

This little system is for the user to display his team using any player he wants.

## ⛓️ Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- Limitations:
> - The Top5 table should show a list containing the highest and lowest ages of its players, but it is currently showing only a list of the highest and lowest ages of the last team creation
> - No unit tests have been written.
> - The code is not 100% clean.
> - Everything is saved in localStorage, but the recommended for a real project would be NodeJs + MongoDB
- Why each limitation exists
> - I didn't have much time to solve everything, but I have enough skills to solve it.
